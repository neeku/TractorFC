### TractorFC ###

================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

TractorFC is a tab-based iPhone application, including four tabs:
1. News
2. Intro
3. Photos
4. League Table

The tabs are handled in the AppDelegate file, in addition to the navigation controller that controls navigation for News Tab. The URL is added in a PLIST file, and contains a feed link from a website which is parsed as XML in RSS Parser.

1. News tab includes a parent view controller called (TitleViewController) in which the news header, intro text, and the image is displayed in customized table view cells. 

Each table view cell contains four subviews: a. news header, b. intro text, c. image d. customized divider as separator line for cells.

The image placeholder uses layer property from QuartzCore to add a border and corner radius.
A default image will be displayed if there are no photos available for an article.


The child view controller (DetailViewController) contains a web view that displays the full description of news along with the title and image. The html/css styles are set in htmlPattern.html file. The web view supports pinch in/out, double tap for zooming in and out.

2. IntroViewController displays an introduction to the team and its fan club. The text is included in a text file called Intro.txt, and what this VC does, is reading the content from the file and display it in a text view.

The content is from Wikipedia.

3. PhotosViewController contains 7 buttons that display 7 static images from the application bundle.
This is just a very basic and simple way of displaying images, and in case we want to submit the app to a public store, this part needs to be improved.

4. LeagueTableViewController is a web view that displays the table from an iframe URL.

Other Resources:

* RssData/RssParser (.h, .m)
  Does all parsing process for the XML.
  Images are stored in an array, and image display is done asynchronously to avoid scrolling lag in table view.

  A lot of optimization is done on the parses, and detailed notes can be found as comments in the files.

* FarsiNumerals (.h, .m)
  Strings with Persian text can be passed to this category to have the numerals displayed in the correct Persian script (not English one).

* WebView Memory Leak (UIWebView+Clean .h, .m)
  If the web view contains a huge amount of contents, it causes a memory leak and makes the app crash. Using this class, the issue is fixed.

* Pro Alert View (.h, .m)
  This is used to customize the alert views.

* HTML Stripper (NSString_StripHTML .h, .m)
  strings from CData Block are passed to HTML Stripper to strip any extra/unwanted HTML tag.

*** Constant.h includes all sizes for different frames and subviews, color codes, font styles, alert messages, etc. which makes manipulating the values much easier.

*** Tab bar item images do not have a @2x version for retina display. They can be added later.

*** Will add a statistics system later. Just writing down as a reminder!
